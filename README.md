# Predictive-Modeling-for-Sustainable-Energy-in-Tetouan
The goal of this Compition held by AI-club at ENSIAS  is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the power consumption of Tetouan city in 10-minute windows using the provided dataset. The project aims to challenge contributors to apply their machine learning skills and knowledge to analyze the dataset and develop models that can accurately forecast power consumption based on historical data, weather conditions, and other relevant factors.

The project dataset contains information on power consumption in Tetouan city's three zone stations (Quads, Smir, and Boussafou) over a period of one year, starting from January 1st, 2017, through December 30th of the same year. The dataset also includes data on temperature, humidity, and other environmental factors that may influence power consumption.

The project aims to provide valuable insights for the city's utility company to optimize power distribution and reduce wastage. Contributors will be expected to develop and test their machine learning models using the provided dataset and various techniques such as regression, time series analysis, or other relevant methods.

The project will reward contributors who develop the most accurate machine learning models with the lowest error rates in their predictions. Additionally, contributors can collaborate and share their knowledge, code, and best practices to develop better models and create an open-source solution that can benefit the wider community.
